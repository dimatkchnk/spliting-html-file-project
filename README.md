# Splitting console program
A program that split a long html file to some shorter files (&lt;head> section is present in every short file).

With polish comments.

## How it works:

Given a long html file, than program is counting all tags in it and finding a <body> tag and saving the beginning (<head>).
Second step is program split the "body" of file to shotrer ones, counting tags and comparing it to maximum of tags in each file.
Than the beginning with "head" is added to all short files.
